This project was made to learn MERN staff connecting React Web App with Node.js and Database in Mongo DB 

#### Working Web App you can see here: https://recruitment-task-wpruchnicki-1.herokuapp.com/ 

## Features: 
- You can add event to the database and delete it form there 
- Form inputs are validated and only correct data can be saved in Database

I used Create React App to make it and also Express Framework to run server.

I used Mongo DB Atlas to create database. 

To provide better UX I used MUI The React component library. 

## How to Run project 

- Go to the main directory and run npm run start - to run server 
- Go to the client folder and run npm run start to run Web App
